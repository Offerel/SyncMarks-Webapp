# SyncMarks WebApp
This is the backend for the bookmark syncing [Browser Extension](../../../../../Offerel/SyncMarks-Extension). This WebApp is build for all Browsers supporting WebExtensions and the Bookmark API and using the SyncMarks Extension. Since it's not allowed to publish plugins for free at Chrome store, i see no way to release the WebExtension in that Store. However, you can sideload the AddOn, if you ant to use it. The Extension is published on [Mozilla AddOns](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/syncmarks/) and Microsoft [Edge Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ffobakhdlfhmnnkmimkbnbmnplihhphg). You can then add, remove, edit and move your bookmarks there and the result is synced back to your Browsers. You can do crossbrowser syncs with this Extension. 

The WebApp functions as the backend for the Extensions. You can add, edit, delete, move and change the bookmarks with this WebApp in any Browser. This works also, when the Extension is not installed.
