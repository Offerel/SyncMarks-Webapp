[![Translate](https://translate.codeberg.org/widget/syncmarks/webapp/svg-badge.svg)](https://translate.codeberg.org/engage/syncmarks/) [![Issues](https://img.shields.io/gitea/issues/open/Offerel/SyncMarks-WebApp?gitea_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodeberg.org%2F)](https://codeberg.org/Offerel/SyncMarks-WebApp/issues) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Offerel/SyncMarks-WebApp) 

This is a backend for the SyncMarks [Browser Extension](../../../../../Offerel/SyncMarks-Extension). This WebApp can be used as central Hub for all installes SyncMarks Extensions. 

The Extension is build for all Browsers supporting WebExtensions and the Bookmark API and using the SyncMarks Extension. Since it's not allowed to publish plugins for free at Chrome store, i see no way to release the WebExtension in that Store. However, you can sideload the AddOn, if you ant to use it. The Extension is published on [Mozilla AddOns](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/syncmarks/) and Microsoft [Edge Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ffobakhdlfhmnnkmimkbnbmnplihhphg). You can then add, remove, edit and move your bookmarks there and the result is synced back to your Browsers. You can do crossbrowser syncs with that Extension. 

The WebApp functions as the backend for the Extensions. You can add, edit, delete, move and change the bookmarks with this WebApp in any Browser. You can use the WebApp completely independently, without an extension and directly in your browser as a standard website.
