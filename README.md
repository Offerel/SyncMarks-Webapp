# SyncMarks (Backend)
This is is a bookmark syncing utility. It's build for all Browsers supportig WebExtensions and the Bookmark API. You can find the WebExtension AddOn's at https://codeberg.org/Offerel/SyncMarks-Extension. Since it's not allowed to publish plugins for free at Chrome store, i see no way to release the WWebExtension in that Store. However, you can sideload the AddOn, if you ant to use it. It is published additionally on Molzilla AddOns and Microsoft Edge Store. You can then add, remove, edit and move your bookmarks there and the result is synced back to your Browsers. You can do crossbrowser syncs with this.
